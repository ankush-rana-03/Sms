# Password Reset Email Functionality Fix

## Issue Description
The password reset functionality was working when an admin reset a teacher's password, but when a teacher changed their own password from their profile, no email notification was being sent.

## Root Cause
The `updatePassword` function in the auth controller (`backend/controllers/auth.js`) was not sending any email notification when a user changed their own password.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Auth Controller
- Modified `updatePassword` function in `backend/controllers/auth.js`
- Added email notification functionality when users change their own password
- Added proper error handling to prevent password update failure if email fails

### 2. Enhanced Email Service
- Added `sendPasswordChangeNotification` method to `backend/services/emailService.js`
- Added `generatePasswordChangeNotificationHTML` method for email template
- Improved error handling and environment variable loading
- Added transporter initialization checks

### 3. Email Templates
- Created professional HTML email template for password change notifications
- Includes user information, security notices, and contact details
- Responsive design with proper styling

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### `backend/controllers/auth.js`
```javascript
// Added email notification to updatePassword function
exports.updatePassword = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.user.id).select('+password');

    // Check current password
    if (!(await user.matchPassword(req.body.currentPassword))) {
      return next(new ErrorResponse('Password is incorrect', 401));
    }

    user.password = req.body.newPassword;
    await user.save();

    // Send email notification about password change
    try {
      const emailService = require('../services/emailService');
      await emailService.sendPasswordChangeNotification({
        name: user.name,
        email: user.email,
        role: user.role
      });
      
      console.log('Password change notification email sent successfully to:', user.email);
    } catch (emailError) {
      console.error('Error sending password change notification email:', emailError);
      // Don't fail the password update if email fails
    }

    sendTokenResponse(user, 200, res);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
};
```

#### `backend/services/emailService.js`
- Added `sendPasswordChangeNotification` method
- Added `generatePasswordChangeNotificationHTML` method
- Improved environment variable loading
- Added transporter initialization checks

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. `test-email-service.js` - Tests admin password reset email
2. `test-password-change-notification.js` - Tests user password change notification

### How to Test

#### 1. Admin Password Reset (Working)
- Admin resets teacher password from Teacher Management
- Email notification sent to teacher with new password

#### 2. Teacher Password Change (Now Fixed)
- Teacher changes their own password from Profile page
- Email notification sent to teacher confirming password change

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test admin password reset email
node test-email-service.js

# Test user password change notification
node test-password-change-notification.js
```

## Email Templates
