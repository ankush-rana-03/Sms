## System Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **SubjectClassAssignment Component**
```tsx
// Location: frontend/src/components/SubjectClassAssignment.tsx
interface SubjectClassAssignment {
  classId: string;
  className: string;
  grade: string;
  section: string;
  subjects: string[];
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Summary statistics

#### 2. **TeacherManagement Integration**
```tsx
// Location: frontend/src/pages/TeacherManagement.tsx
// New action button added to teacher table
<Tooltip title="Assign Subjects">
  <IconButton
    size="small"
    onClick={() => handleOpenSubjectAssignmentDialog(teacher)}
  >
    <Assignment />
  </IconButton>
</Tooltip>
```

### Backend Integration

The system uses the existing class assignment API with enhanced data structure:

```typescript
// Assignment data structure
{
  class: string;        // Class ID
  section: string;      // Section (A, B, C, etc.)
  subject: string;      // Comma-separated subjects
  grade: string;        // Grade level
}
```

## User Workflow

### 1. **Accessing Subject Assignment**
1. Navigate to Teacher Management
2. Find the teacher in the list
3. Click the "Assign Subjects" button (Assignment icon)
4. Subject assignment dialog opens

### 2. **Managing Assignments**

#### **View Current Assignments**
- Current assignments displayed as cards
- Each card shows: Class name, Section, Grade, Subjects
- Remove assignments with delete button

#### **Add New Assignment**
1. Select class from dropdown (only unassigned classes shown)
2. Enter subjects (comma-separated)
3. Use common subjects chips for quick selection
4. Click "Add Assignment"

#### **Save Changes**

## Common Subjects Available

The system includes a comprehensive list of common subjects:

```typescript
const commonSubjects = [
  'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English', 'Hindi',
  'History', 'Geography', 'Civics', 'Economics', 'Computer Science',
  'Physical Education', 'Art', 'Music', 'Social Studies', 'Science',
  'Literature', 'Grammar', 'Environmental Studies', 'Value Education'
];
```

## Data Flow

### 1. **Assignment Creation**
```
User Input → Validation → Assignment Object → Backend API → Database
```

### 2. **Assignment Retrieval**
```
Database → Backend API → Teacher Data → UI Display
```

### 3. **Assignment Update**
```
Current Assignments → User Modifications → Validation → Backend API → Database
```

## Validation Rules

### 1. **Assignment Validation**
- ✅ Class must be selected
- ✅ At least one subject required
- ✅ No duplicate class assignments
- ✅ Valid class data

### 2. **Subject Validation**
- ✅ Subjects trimmed of whitespace
- ✅ Empty subjects filtered out
- ✅ Comma-separated format supported
- ✅ Quick selection from common subjects

### 3. **UI Validation**
- ✅ Disable add button when required fields empty
- ✅ Show error messages for invalid input
- ✅ Prevent duplicate assignments
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback

## Benefits

### 1. **For Administrators**
- ✅ Clear overview of teacher assignments
- ✅ Easy assignment management
- ✅ Prevent assignment conflicts
- ✅ Track assignment statistics

### 2. **For Teachers**

- ✅ Specific class and subject assignments
- ✅ Organized teaching schedule

### 3. **For Students**

- ✅ Clear teacher responsibilities
- ✅ Organized class structure

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Component Structure**
```
SubjectClassAssignment
├── Current Assignments Display
├── Add New Assignment Form
│   ├── Class Selection
│   ├── Subject Input
│   └── Common Subjects
├── Assignment Management
└── Summary Statistics
```

### 2. **State Management**
```typescript
// Assignment state
const [assignments, setAssignments] = useState<SubjectClassAssignment[]>([]);

// Form state
const [selectedClass, setSelectedClass] = useState<string>('');
const [selectedSubjects, setSelectedSubjects] = useState<string>('');
const [error, setError] = useState<string>('');
```

### 3. **API Integration**
```typescript
// Save assignments
const handleSaveSubjectAssignments = async (assignments: any[]) => {
  const assignmentData = assignments.map(assignment => ({
    class: assignment.classId,
    section: assignment.section,
    subject: assignment.subjects.join(', '),
    grade: assignment.grade
  }));
  
  await apiService.post(`/admin/teachers/${teacherId}/assign-classes`, {
    assignedClasses: assignmentData
  });
};
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Basic Assignment**
```
Class: Class 10A
Subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry
Result: Teacher assigned to teach Math, Physics, Chemistry to Class 10A
```

### 2. **Multiple Classes**
```
Class 9A: English, Literature
Class 9B: English, Literature
Class 10A: Mathematics, Physics
Result: Teacher assigned to multiple classes with different subjects
```

### 3. **Subject Management**
```
Input: "Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry"
Process: Split by comma, trim whitespace, filter empty
Result: ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry"]
```
