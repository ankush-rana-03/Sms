## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Express.js framework

### Backend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Database Setup
The system automatically creates necessary indexes and collections. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.

## üìä Data Model

### TeacherAssignment Schema
```javascript
{
  teacher: ObjectId,        // Reference to Teacher
  class: ObjectId,          // Reference to Class
  subject: String,          // Subject name
  day: String,              // Day of week (Monday-Sunday)
  startTime: String,        // Start time (HH:MM format)
  endTime: String,          // End time (HH:MM format)
  academicYear: String,     // Academic year (e.g., "2024-2025")
  semester: String,         // Semester (First-Eighth)
  isActive: Boolean,        // Assignment status
  notes: String,            // Additional notes
  createdBy: ObjectId,      // User who created
  updatedBy: ObjectId,      // User who last updated
  timestamps: true          // Created/updated timestamps
}
```

### Validation Rules
- **Time Format**: HH:MM (24-hour format)
- **Days**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- **Semesters**: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth
- **Time Logic**: Start time must be before end time
- **Conflict Prevention**: No overlapping schedules for same teacher/class on same day

## üß™ Testing

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
node test-teacher-assignment-system.js
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Messages
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors, missing fields
- **404 Not Found**: Assignment, teacher, or class not found
- **409 Conflict**: Time conflicts, duplicate assignments
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side errors

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message",
  "error": "Detailed error information",
  "conflicts": [] // For time conflict errors
}
```

## üîÑ Conflict Detection Logic

### Teacher Conflicts
- Prevents same teacher from having overlapping schedules
- Checks all assignments for the same teacher on the same day
- Considers academic year and semester

### Class Conflicts
- Prevents same class from having overlapping schedules
- Ensures no double-booking of classroom time
- Maintains class schedule integrity

### Time Overlap Detection
```javascript
// Overlap scenarios detected:
// 1. New assignment starts during existing assignment
// 2. New assignment ends during existing assignment
// 3. New assignment completely contains existing assignment
// 4. New assignment is completely contained by existing assignment
```

const conflictCheck = {
  teacherId: "teacher_id_here",
  day: "Monday",
  startTime: "09:30",
  endTime: "10:30",
  semester: "First"
};

const response = await fetch('/api/assignments/check-conflicts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
