# Teacher Management System - Fixes Applied

## Overview
Fixed the teacher management functionality and ensured Netlify build compatibility. The system now properly handles teacher creation, updates, deletion, and monitoring.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Endpoint Corrections
**Problem**: Frontend was using incorrect API endpoints (`/admin/teacher-management` instead of `/admin/teachers`)

**Solution**: Updated all API calls in `TeacherManagement.tsx` to use the correct endpoints:
- `GET /admin/teachers` - Fetch all teachers
- `POST /admin/teachers` - Create new teacher
- `PUT /admin/teachers/:id` - Update teacher
- `DELETE /admin/teachers/:id` - Delete teacher
- `GET /admin/teachers/statistics/overview` - Get statistics
- `GET /admin/teachers/:id/login-logs` - Get login logs
- `POST /admin/teachers/:id/reset-password` - Reset password
- `POST /admin/teachers/:id/assign-classes` - Assign classes

### 2. Data Structure Alignment
**Problem**: Form data structure didn't match backend expectations

**Solution**: Updated form data handling:
- Changed `subjects` from string to array
- Added `specialization` array field
- Added `salary` field
- Properly structured `contactInfo.emergencyContact`
- Fixed date handling for `joiningDate`

### 3. API Service Integration
**Problem**: Mixed usage of direct fetch calls and apiService

**Solution**: Standardized all API calls to use the centralized `apiService`:
- Consistent error handling
- Proper authentication headers
- Standardized response handling

### 4. Form Validation and Data Processing
**Problem**: Form fields weren't properly handling array data

**Solution**: 
- Added proper array handling for subjects and specialization
- Added salary input field
- Added emergency contact fields
- Improved data validation and processing

### 5. Error Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across different operations

**Solution**: 
- Standardized error messages
- Added proper try-catch blocks
- Improved user feedback through snackbar notifications
