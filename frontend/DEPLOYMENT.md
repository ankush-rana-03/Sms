# Deploying to Netlify

Your React application is ready to be deployed to Netlify! Here are several ways to do it:

## Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended)

2. **Sign up or log in**
3. **Click "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"**
4. **Drag and drop the `build` folder** from this directory
5. **Your site will be live instantly!**

## Option 2: Using Netlify CLI

### Prerequisites:
- Netlify account

   netlify login
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
   ```

## Option 3: Using Access Token

1. **Get your Netlify access token:**
   - Go to [Netlify User Settings](https://app.netlify.com/user/settings/tokens)
   - Create a new access token

2. **Deploy with token:**

```
